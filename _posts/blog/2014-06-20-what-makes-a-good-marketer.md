title:  "What Makes a Great Marketer?"

In sales, there's the ever-looming question on whether the best salespeople are born or made. Marketers fall into the same pool of people. However, successful marketers can be at both ends of a spectrum. You can be considered great if you are extra gregarious and outgoing, as well as, quiet and deeply analytical. However I think to be a *great* marketer, you need to bridge the gap between the two, without being a mediocre generalist.

There's a post out there from Rand, that talks about the [T-Shaped Marketer](http://moz.com/rand/the-t-shaped-web-marketer/). But what makes a great marketer isn't the immediate skills they know - those can be picked up and mastered with time, but rather the ability to learn and apply.

So, what makes a great marketer?

## Deeply Analytical

This one is a given. You can't go out there, spewing stuff out of your brain and saying it's going to work. Data plays such an important role in successful marketing, that knowing how to make sense out of large sets of data can be the 'making' factor.

I'm not talking about understanding things like CPC, ARPU, LTV, CPM, CPA, ABCDEFG. Those are just silly acronyms that everyone just throws on their resume because recruiters look for them.

**I'm talking about whether you can recognize patterns and trends while you're working, and while you're optimizing.**
* Can you recognize when a messy dataset is trending?
* Are you able to make sense of patterns and determine whether they are statistically significant?

But really, this chunk of it boils down to whether you can live inside an analytics suite all day and come up with strategic movements.

Good marketing is both chess and checkers. It all starts with how you plan your moves. When your plans work out and you're able to make multiple skips across the board, or when you take out a key piece, it really feels good.

## Objectively Creative

Being able to create is a pre-requesite of a marketer. At any given point of time, you'll need to be able to pull something out of nowhere, whether you have the resources or not. You don't always have months of lead time to really craft out a single tweet. Recognize opportunity and seize it. Move fast. No one will hold your failures against you.

Being creative runs deep. To get better, constantly think of solutions to things you don't normally solve. It doesn't matter whether it's an engineering problem, or a new design iteration. Everything comes back to marketing.

* Be able to estimate how and how much a user will convert on your landing page and also be able to reason why.
* Be able to make intuitive design decisions based on your own objectivity.
* Know why you are creating something, and understand how it's going to impact things down the road.

It's not about spewing out content. It's about doing what *feels* right.

## Good Eye for Design

We all know that usage is in the marketing realm. When it comes to it, design is a huge influencer in usage. Know when something is crap, know when to favor data, and when to favor the feeling of right.

Design doesn't always follow rules. You don't have to be able to create to know whether something is good or bad. As long as you understand why something is the way it is, and how it can be improved.

Design is not always about art and visuals. Interactions play a huge part in how someone engages or bounces.

* The ability to explain why users stop engaging after a certain nested level of interaction.
* Reasons behind choosing your own credit card form over Stripe checkout.
* Designing for architecture is not the same as designing for the user. Often times, the most efficient way is not the best way.

This is about how something feels to you, and the reasons why it feels right.

## Technical Enough

Engineers like self sufficient marketers. Be technical enough to know how to ask for something, without wasting time. You should be technical enough to carry a medium-level conversation on why something is done the way it is from an engineering perspective.

Engineers will be creating the the optimizations you design. The better you are able to interact with them, and help along in the process, the better your outcomes will be.

Be able to deploy your own third party code with minimal help. You don't need an engineer to install your CrazyEgg JS, or a tracking pixel for referrals.

## Effective Communicator

Be able to convey whatever is behind your choices to both someone who understands more than you, and less than you. When someone understands why you are doing or want to do something, the easier it is down the road.

Be simple and/or technical at the correct times.

## Expert Storyteller

(Suggested by [Ashley Tate](https://twitter.com/ashtate))

Ah yes. The ol' Content is King saying. It really is. Everything you do revolves around content. Email, blogs, Ads. Everything is based around expertly crafted words.

Being able to tell a story and convey sides through words is a great necessity.

You can't learn this in school, write from within.

## Big Picture

You have a list of attributes that any one of them alone is valuable. Know when to be the specialist, and when to be the generalist.

Being a Swiss Army Knife is useful. As long as you understand that it is not at the same time and place where having a hunting knife is.

Alternatively, being a big hunting knife is useful, but there are just some times where a Swiss Army Knife is more practical.

Understanding the differences between these two situations is the basis on being a great marketer.
