title:  "Four Words That Will Destroy You"
categories: blog
---

The worst thing you can do for yourself is to metaphorically shoot yourself in the foot, before you've started anything. The problem is not the words themselves that destroy you, but the mindset that leads you to them.

What I've learned from talking to a number of different people is that there are many 1-bit ways of separation. They are all simple, and for the most part, true. *Doers and Don'ters*, *Leaders and Followers* - shockingly simple, however, true.

Yes, there may be outliers, or inliers, for this matter. But talk to enough people, and you'll see people putting themselves in their circle.

> *...people putting themselves in their circle.*

That's the problem, basic human psychology says that people want to belong, and when there's no longer someone to tell them where they supposedly should belong, *they place themselves.* Many times, the place they choose, is misguided.

**I can't do that.** or **I wish I could.**

The number one thing I'll take away from startups and being thrown into the deep end - is that there is no such thing as **"I can't."**. There really isn't. The only barrier that stops you from reaching the other side of the pool is your mindset. Those years of believing what you believe, whether it's that you can't do anything else, or that there's no fathomable way of getting *there*, it's all wrong. **You can do it**, the only thing you need to realize that you are the only barrier to yourself.

If you told my college-freshman self that I'd be doing what I'm doing today, I probably would have said **I can't**. Because at the time, I placed myself. *Don't place yourself*.

**Break the negativity**

Today marks 28 straight days that I've done at least 3 hours worth of productive work. For the time being, *doing* is all I know. I'm won't get to where I want to be by partying, wasting time, or whatever.

Eventually I'll take a vacation, unwind, and burn the oil once again. Not one person has said I'm crazy. This is the people you want to be around, those who don't say **I can't**. Especially not those who say that **you can't**.

Break out of your anchoring mindset. You are what you believe you are.
