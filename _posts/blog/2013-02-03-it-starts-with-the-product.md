Growth hacking, or whatever you want to call it, varies greatly from startup to startup, and from stage to stage. What you do can change overnight.

So what is it then, early stage growth? What do you actually do? Well after 6 months of working at [Divshot](http:/divshot.com), I get it now. After doing what I did at Moz, and doing what I did at Stride, applying the same things only worked so well, and only moved the needle by so much. I needed to really dive in and figure it out.

So, how do you do early stage growth?

# Start the flywheel

Get some users in the door, and have a consistent flow of new users. This might be the most difficult thing you do. [Get that flywheel turning](http://moz.com/blog/building-a-marketing-flywheel-whiteboard-friday) with a combination of short and long term pushes.

**Short term**

Getting press, social buzz, newsletters, these are all things you can do right away to get users in the door. Prompt them to share, and you can get a stream of users that will last you a couple months.

**Long term**

You can't spend all of your time on short term growth. Everything will go badly if you do, and you'll be sitting there scratching your head.

At this stage, don't waste your time A/B testing, re-writing copy, or wasting money on sponsored posts or ads on other websites. Focus on things like SEO, content, and building the brand. You want to position yourself as a thought leader in whatever it is you do.

# Embrace your early adopters

I cannot stress enough how important it is to not abandon your first 1000 users. A majority subset of these people will be very willing to give you feedback, and you'll need to collect and act on it.

My favorite tool to recommend is [Intercom](http://intercom.io). It takes awhile to set up, but it's well worth it once you get it right.

**Refine the product**

Take this straight up - you are not Apple. Don't try to be. User feedback is very important, and you should act on it. If you're busy building away, ignoring your users, **STOP**. Every user who submits feedback either loves your product, or is giving you a reason why they are going to stop using it. Attend to them and you can create a customer for life, ignore them and you'll have people taking away from your brand.

**Prompt for user feedback**

Use event based triggers to prompt feedback, you can gain a lot of information just by aggregating user actions and triggers. Here's how I do it at Divshot:

At it's peak, before we dove into the product again, we gathered 50 new bits of actionable feedback every 24 hours. People pay thousands of dollars to focus groups for this stuff. We're getting it for free.

# Return to the product

You don't generate and retain customers with a mediocre product. There shouldn't be a time where you stop refining and evolving. With so many variables involved with product management and product development, you need to realize that the landscape and product-market fit constantly changes and moves along with your users. If you fail to continually adapt to this, it's disastrous.

If you're focused on the growth side, you should be constantly reviewing user lifecycles, repeatedly doing the 'new user' experience, and submitting feedback and user stories to your development team.

**Dogfooding**

This is key to ensuring you're still balancing your core values. If you stop using your product to grow yourself, you've deviated too far away from your core value. A startup is said to be on a destructive path if they stop using their own product.

# Lather, Rinse, Repeat

Early-stage startup growth is a evolving and repeating cycle. At each growth jump, you need to step back and look at the big picture. A good growth person does, a great growth person develops.
