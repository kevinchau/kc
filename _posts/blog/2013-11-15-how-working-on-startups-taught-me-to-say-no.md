title:  "How Working on Startups Taught Me to Say No"
categories: blog

Very early in our lives we are taught to accept what's offered to us. Maybe it's the culture passed down from our parents. Maybe it's the incessant need to fit in. Maybe it's something else. Whatever it is, some eventually learn to avoid becoming the [Yes Man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_Man_(film)). We learn to say **no**.

Situational or not, the word **no** carries weight that isn't found in it's opposite, *yes*. The word **no** is confidence. It's everything against the current.

### As Help

The most interesting situation that this has gotten me into has been when I find myself pseudo mentoring my friends still in college. We'll call my friend *Adam*.

Adam was deciding on what he wanted to do. He had to decide on a major, and he wanted to figure out where his passions lay. Adam started off telling me about his experiences in class. He told me what he found interesting, and what he didn't. He had a mind full of ideas.

Eventually, he started talking about the kind of career he would like to have. Adam asked me what I thought; I stared at him for a few seconds, I twitched my face. Then, all I said was **no**.

He leaned back with a confused look on his face. Adam started to think about why I responded the way I did. He didn't ask me why. Soon after, he started talking again, trying to justify his idea, but he stopped himself, realizing why I said no. He found the fault to his own story. A fault only he could have found.

The thing is, Adam was seeking approval of his own idea. He wanted some validation to his half thought about story. A story he wasn't sure about. By giving such a vague answer - he sparked his own thought.

### It All Comes Back to the Gut

I learned to say no, because I learned to slow down and listen to my gut. If someone comes to you with a proposal that sounds right, but doesn't feel right, reject it. Say nothing else. What happens next is wondrous.

I also learned to say no, because people let me experience hard failure. It's a sobering experience. It's invaluable. It's something I needed to experience, because the next time someone said **no**, I had something to go back on to understand why.

### Startups in Particular

I point out startups because it has been an environment where I'm able to think freely, to be allowed to fail, and to be throw in the water. All important experiences.

I've been allowed to quickly tear down many of my old ways, only to rebuild them again. Saying **no** was one of them.

Both [Stride](https://strideapp.com) and [Divshot](http://divshot.com) have given me that. It's the sink or swim environment that you find in few places. It works.
