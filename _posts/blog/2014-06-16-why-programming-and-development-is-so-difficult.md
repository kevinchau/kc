title:  "Why Programming and Development is so Difficult"
categories: blog
---

Over the past few weeks I've been diving into a few things: AngularJS, and Python. Needless to say, it's fun, but damn is it hard. However, it's no different than other hard sciences (Chemistry, Biology, etc). That doesn't mean it's as easy.

I've talked with a lot of people on why I've been struggling with programming, and why I didn't experience the same struggle with the sciences in college. I believe it is because of just the massive size of the programming toolbox that is hard to grasp on your own.

### Toolbox

When I say toolbox, it's all of the little things you can use to achieve your programming goal. For those who have taken Organic Chemistry, an example of a tool in your toolbox would be Hoffman's Elimination, adding 2 chemicals to turn amines into alkenes (I vaguely remember, so don't hold this against me). Web development is no different, for example if you want to make an API call, you can use something like Httplib or Requests in Python.

However that's exactly where it gets really difficult. Where the natural sciences has a clear and predefined start and end, programming doesn't necessarily have that. Because there are so many different ways to do something, and nearly everyone has a different approach, getting help isn't easy either.

It's also exactly why so many people, myself included, struggle. Unlike in the sciences where your middle step has very clearly defined purpose, whether that is to split the DNA strands using a Helicase, or permeating cell membranes with electricity, each *thing* you do is well defined.

A main complain that I have is that I can do science, because I know exactly what is in my toolbox, and I know what everything does. I know because I've done all of those things before.

My development toolbox is rather spartan because it's very time consuming to find a Python Module, or a Ruby Gem that does what you need, and then going through all of the documentation only to find that it doesn't, and you need to use another thing alongside it. Perhaps this is why development boot camps are so popular. It's essentially: "Here are your tools to build x."

### You just have to grind it

Unfortunately, I haven't discovered an easy way to do it. Many times have I architected something out, only to toss it after starting, because midway through I discovered a better way to do something.

That's exactly how you become fluent at development, you get stuck somewhere, spend an hour or two perusing Stack Overflow to find your answer.

That's exactly where the problem begins though, someone starting out is highly likely to get discouraged from learning, because it's akin to learning a foreign (spoken) language. There's a high learning curve, but once you figure out how to dig your way out of problems, it gets a lot easier.

You just have to grind it.

### Don't just build a calculator

The other piece of learning is passion. This is the same kind of passion that home auto mechanics have. It's something that you need to *want* to do yourself in order to get better. I really don't recommend doing it in rage to solve something really fast - you will likely just fail and it will put you off even more.

That's where the phrase 'don't just build a calculator' comes from. If you build a calculator, you are building for the sake of building. Not for learning.

My first real project was sniffing API packets coming from iOS and emulating them in the console, while building logic in the process so I wouldn't have to keep making those actions on my own (if you must know, it was sniffing API calls from Tinder).

Doing a rather basic task successfully gave me the confidence to go to AngelHack and hack on a project called [SocialWall](http://socialwall.divshot.io). I wanted to be able to contribute at a hackathon, not just sit there and SCRUM, or write copy and wireframes the whole time.

That project at AngelHack was a finalist.

I didn't have to spend anytime getting a web server up and going for Angular, because of the company I'm with - [Divshot](http://www.divshot.com). Because of that, my pitch was not on localhost, and was live on production.

As a special bonus - use the code KEVIN at [divshot.com/code](http://divshot.com/code) to get 3 months free of hosting.

### It does get easier

But you just have to do it. Learning how to do this stuff also has made me a better marketer, believe it or not.
