title:  "My Frustration with the Auto Industry"
categories: blog

As my first (new) car, my 2007 VW GTI, has crossed the 6 digit mark, I once again begin my plan on my next car. I've learned a lot from owning this car, the return of turbochargers, the technology of direct injection, and the pitfalls of new technology.

Owning the GTI that marked the return of the hot hatch has set the bar very high in what I look for in my next car. My understanding of the mechanical function, drivability, and long-term ownership has skyrocketed.

It has been 7 years in the US since VW released the 5th generation GTI. Let's take a look at the key points of this car.

* 32mpg Highway
* 200hp (which has been around 280 with readily available mods and software)
* Turbo
* Direct Injection
* Twin-clutch transmission

Compare those key elements with new cars you can buy today. The cars that I have been comparing as a possible next are the:

* [BMW M235i](http://www.caranddriver.com/news/2014-bmw-2-series-228i-m235i-photos-and-info-news)
* [Mercedes CLA 45 AMG](http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2014-mercedes-benz-cla45-amg-first-drive-review)
* [Subaru WRX (STI)](http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2015-subaru-wrx-sedan-first-drive-review)
* [Subaru BRZ/Scion FR-S](http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2013-subaru-brz-sports-car-first-drive-review)

Technology wise, there is no measurable jump from the 2007 GTI that I own, to any of these 2014/2015 models.

* The BMW and Mercedes create similar power, and consume similar amounts of fuel to my GTI.
* Direct injection leads to carbon build up in the valves, and problems will arise down the road. They have not solved this (Toyota has).
* The WRX consumes fuel like a fighter biplane.
* The BRZ is underpowered and overpriced.

**This is my problem with the auto industry**

Around the 7 years that has elapsed since I first bought my GTI,

* Twitter and Facebook were founded and had successful IPOs.
* Elon Musk and SpaceX sent a spacecraft to the ISS.
* Tesla created a viable (and insanely fun) electric car.
* Miley Cyrus Twerked.
* Apple created the iPhone and turned the mobile phone industry upside down.
* Steve Jobs unveiled the iPad to a world of critics.

The auto industry? They added Bluetooth. Nothing else has changed. Oh, the Leaf. I guess that's a thing. But GM already made one and killed one.

I *cannot wait* for Tesla to release their next model (rumored as Model E). I will buy one as soon as it is announced.

I honestly just want a car that doesn't pollute the environment, is fun to drive, is **safe**, and doesn't make my hands smell like a chemistry lab when it needs more range.

Auto industry, you're slow. I hate you. May this blog post mark my intentions to not buy another fossil-fuel powered vehicle again.

*As a side note, the Tesla Model S is the perfect car, minus the 80k+ price tag.*
