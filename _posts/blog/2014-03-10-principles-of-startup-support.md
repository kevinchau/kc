title:  "Principles of Startup Support"

Support is the most important thing on the user-facing side of a startup. Because what's more important than your customers? No other single area can improve or destroy acquisition, experience, and retention.

If you believe in the style of [doing things that don't scale](http://paulgraham.com/ds.html), then you *need* to have good support.

I’ve been paying attention to how good companies do support, and how bad companies do support. If you follow me on Twitter, then you’ve seen my recent rage from the absolute terrible support by Bank of America and US Bank. This sparked the concept of exceptional support.

### Good support follows the principles below:
1. Acknowledge fault or concern
2. Immediately resolve the initial problem as best as possible with information given.
3. Offer condolences and be take a welcoming tone to their outreach.
4. Make sure that their overall experience with the product is good. If it isn't, rectify it in as few emails as possible.
5. Leave it open ended and encourage them to contact you again.

**Excellent support also includes:**
* Keep the mood upbeat and raise the overall morale of the conversation, while maintaining a professional tone.

One of my favorite companies, Everlane, has continued to up the bar in support quality. Every time I email them they never cease to provide excellent support, as demonstrated in their response below.

### Exceptional support extends beyond the designed team

More and more companies are looping in other teams to partake in support. Moz has done this with their 'Help Team University'. And Stripe frequently encourages engineers to tackle more difficult questions.

The benefits of this flow out further than reducing support team load. It allows others to see the real world issues that customers run into and also provide solution examples to other teams.

Yet, overdoing this can lead to an absolute mess. Support is one of those things that require processes to be in place. Without them, it's just a giant mess of things.

#### Triage

If you have an early stage startup, then everyone needs to be involved in handling support tickets. This means there should be a Triage process in place.

Unless everyone sets aside time to handle support tasks daily, there has to be a proper process to follow.

Every team does things differently, but there are universal things that don't work.

* Assigning tickets as a first triage process often leads to black holes. Doing this removes the email from the global queue and someone available to take tickets won't be able to see it.

* Tickets are **always** time sensitive. Not clearing out the inbox at least twice a day can lead to leftover customers and cancelled accounts.

* As in medicine, the users who are bleeding are served first. This means that if your product is stopping them from doing what they need to do. Fix it now.

### Conclusion

Support is a huge part of the Business Development process. BD isn't just about deals and partnerships - it involves *perfecting* everything on the customer facing side.
