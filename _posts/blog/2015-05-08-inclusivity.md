The tech industry will destroy itself from the inside out if it continues to go down the path it's on. [Women are leaving](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-women-tech-20150222-story.html#page=1), [Minorities are well underrepresented](http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/10/12/silicon-valley-diversity-tech-hiring-computer-science-graduates-african-american-hispanic/14684211/), people in tech just don't seem to care about things outside of tech *(Read this a month or so ago, can't find the link)*. If tech is one of the biggest forces that instigate change, disruption, and progressive projects that move forward, why are we still stuck in the Mad Men era when it comes to not making it easier for people to come and stay?

Just about three years ago, I was an outsider looking in at the tech industry. To an outsider, this is an insanely difficult industry to break in to. There might as well be clubhouses, secret handshakes, private bat-phones. (And there are!). I got lucky. Someone decided take me under their wing and give me a shot. They showed me have to navigate the space, how things are done, and functioned as my guiding light while I found my way. 

People in tech are very good at keeping each other in tech. They're very bad at creating an inclusive environment where others can come in. It's quite the dillemma. The people who are currently in tech are not any smarter or more creative than those outside of it. They certainly don't work harder than other industries. So why is it that tech is such an excluding industry?

So much magic has already been done in tech. But it's like hollywood, it's mostly the same people who are at the top. I bet some of them can't even write a line of code to save their asses. So no, the "you're not an engineer" or "you can't code" argument doesn't fly here.

If tech is a mecca for changing our lives, then we should be encouraging more of every people to try their hand in the industry.

## Fake Inclusivity

One thing that has really bothered me about tech are the opportunistic players that are parasitically feeding off the dreams of those who want to enter the space. They do a very good job of masking the underlying motive and creating the all-encompassing image that they are making the space better.

These are the companies and organizations that are enforcing the "startup fad". They are creating the image that founding a startup, any startup, is sexy and cool. 

In reality, they are bridge trolls. They have created an imaginary golden, diamond encrusted bridge for outsiders - and then proceed to spray fog all around it. Want to pass and enter into tech? Give us your money. Give us your equity for what should be free in return.

I went to events run by these troll players in the space once or twice. They attract people who have dreams and ideas. Then when you are hooked, they offer you a guiding light for a nice chunk of equity. I did not, and would not take the bait. 

These trolls only exist because of the excluding nature that is tech. Do you think they would still exist if navigating the tech industry were easy for outsiders?


## Creating Diversity

Tech is a powerful, powerful place. There's so much public and private money in it. The top players in tech already have so much power in shaping the future of it, and this is just the beginning.

Tech exists because of the liberal mindset and progressive nature of a collective mindset. As inequality grows and grows, and more powerful figureheads are created. There needs to be accountability. The longer we wait to create a more diverse and inclusive environment, the harder it will get.

Remember, tech used to be the underdog. It is no longer.

I will expand on Diversity in an upcoming blog post.


## Keeping it Real

This is an industry that's very good at talking about itself, but not really acting on it. I see articles related to Women in Tech every day, but yet - why is there not a bigger movement happening? I do not believe that this is a case of *the pen is mightier than the sword*. Stop writing *about* the issue, and start writing *from* the issue.

If and when I get to a place where I'm able to make a bigger change than now. You can certainly bet that I'm going spend more of my time dishing out help for free.

## Creating Inclusivity

If tech is going to grow as a diverse industry that welcomes those with ideas and dreams, there needs to be a starting point.

* Create a true entrepreneurship presence at the university level. Currently, young minds are being dominated by Big Consulting and think that you need years of experience to go out and start your own thing. Also, there needs to be encouragement to pursue entrepreneurship, not just the marketing of the MBA in Entrepreneurship - which is a contradiction in itself. You don't need an MBA, nor should you want one, especially in the young industry that is tech.

* Companies should actively promote their diversity goals. Apple is doing a great job at this. Allowing people the freedom to express that they are non-white males, without fear of retribution, is highly important. The freedom to express oneself leads to higher morale and unlocked creativity. It's more than just OK to be LGBT, black, hispanic, native, or any other minority. You are who you are, and your workplace should support you in being yourself.

* In venture capital, [companies with women CEOs have only received *3%* of total VC investment](http://www.babson.edu/news-events/babson-news/Pages/140930-venture-capital-funding-women-entrepreneurs-study.aspx). Why is that? This is a huge problem. [VCs need to stop being misogynists](http://recode.net/2014/08/21/ycs-jessica-livingston-was-hit-on-by-a-vc-on-the-way-to-this-interview/) and encourage more women to pursue entrepreneurship and if fitting, capital investment. I understand that angel rounds and early-stage capital are very personal investments. But if barriers are not broken for others to enter the industry now, the future will have even more friction.
