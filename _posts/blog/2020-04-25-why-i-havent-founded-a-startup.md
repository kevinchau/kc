title:  "Why I Haven't Founded a Startup"
categories: blog

I get frequently asked about why I haven't ran out to do my own thing yet. The thing is, I know exactly why I haven't done so yet, and why I have no 'plans' to do it. I work on cool things, it doesn't matter if I own 100% or 1%. If I have creative control and can think entpreneurially, I'm happy.

### I am not in the business doing a startup for the sake of doing a startup

Let's admit it, in cities that are mostly dominated by large monolithic tech companies, startups are a fad. I am not one to run out and *build a startup*. This is a futile attempt, and is more or less encouraged by two large hackathon companies out there. A *true* startup is the result of a cool product hitting critical mass. Companies should be made because you have made a cool product, and need to house it in a legal entity to protect yourself from your awesomeness.

### None of my projects have reached critical mass

I work on lots of side projects. Things that I do for my own continuing education and do for the sake of learning. These do not need to be a company on paper... *yet*. I do a lot of things becuase I am curious by nature, and love to tinker. I may release some of these projects to the public, and let them run wild. At this point I'll need to form an LLC to house it, but in my eyes, it isn't a *startup*. It's a cool product, that needs to have it's own legal entity so I don't screw myself.

### Time is the most valuable currency, I do not waste time

I have been down the fad road before. Not only have I wasted my time, but I've wasted the time of others. VC's, friends, colleagues. I do not like wasting my time, or other people's time.
