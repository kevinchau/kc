I do a good amount of customer support and handling support tickets on a day to day basis. I've learned quite a bit not just on the product I'm supporting, but how to talk to customer support when it's my turn to need help. Customer Support is a two way street and there are a few rules and guidelines that you should follow to not only be a delightful human being, but to get the best help you can.

### Rule #1: You are not the Queen of England

Even if you are the Queen your issue may not be the most important there is. You know who is more important? The people who emailed or called before you did. Unless your issue is a figurative life-and-death situation (e.g. this is blocking you from doing what you need to do), try not to piss the person helping you off. Even if it is a dire situation, don't be an ass, dude. Respect who is helping you and consider the time of which you are requesting help.

### Rule #2: Provide details

It is very important to provide details of your support issue. Not only will this help the provider figure out what is going on, it saves time. Details such as logs, photos, good descriptions of the issue, and info to find your account faster help tremendously. The more detail you provide up front, the less they will have to ask later.

### Rule #3: Don't change your situation

If you're already having a problem that you can't fix on your own, just stop. Emailing back and forth while tinkering with your account or product changes the situation and the person offering support has to start over again. Based on the information you provide support, there are thought processes, and specific questions they need to ask to figure out what is going on. Changing things in the background only brings you back to square one.

### Rule #4: Don't be a smart ass

If you emailed support - you have admitted defeat. You couldn't figure it out on your own. So don't try to tell the person offering you support, how to do their job. You are here to get help - go along with the process (even if you have to fake it - like I do with Comcast and them needing to think I need to restart my computer.). This helps the person helping you understand what is going on and will lead them towards the answer. Telling them what they are doing is wrong will only piss them off and slow them down, which in turn, slows you down.

### Rule #5: Be happy with who you have

Most support teams are there to solve your problem (yeah, I know right?), unless it's a giant corporation that's out to maximize tickets. So instead of escalating or asking for a manager or supervisor right away, work with the person you have until you reach an impass - they're here to help you, seriously. If you did your job and provided details of your problem - the person helping you will ask for guidance from others on their team automatically.
