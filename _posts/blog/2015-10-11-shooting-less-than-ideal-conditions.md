Recently I did a photoshoot in Hong Kong with a few awesome people. Everything turned out in a favorable way, but it wasn't without some scare.

I had looked outside of my window in HK, and saw sun. It wasn't until I got to the location that I remembered that there were tall buildings everywhere. Leaving my Profoto B2s back at home base, I only grabbed a reflector, and was at least an hour away round trip.

By the time I had the first outfit shot at two locations, the sun disappeared. It became overcast conditions, not my favorite when there's texture around. I called an audible to shoot inside PMQ, an old converted police training center. The only place that was closed off enough was a stairwell.

It was lit with only compact fluorescent bulbs in fixtures, one at mid level, and the other at the top level. Here's what it looked out straight out of camera.

I keep my camera to daylight balance and shoot in RAW. It's easy to see the green tint and color cast from the compact fluorescents. The look I wanted to pull from this was the hard, cold, and edgy, urban feel.

I had Profoto Sunsilver reflector bouncing light onto the model from as close as possible to the lighting fixture. This would create as warm of a possible cast on the model, as the bounced light will fade as it does with the inverse square law. As long as I could get the skin tone proper, I can do the rest in post.

I'm pushing the Fujifilm RAW files to their limit. All of this is done in lightroom.

The only thing left was to create a "lighted" look on the model. because this was shot against a wall, it's easy to apply two graident filters, one behind, and one in front.

The left filter is as follows:

And here is the right filter:

Here's the before and after:

Sometimes when you regretfully leave lighting equipment behind, you have to make the best with what you have, this was one of those situations where I knew it was easily possible to pull of the look I wanted.
