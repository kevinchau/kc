title:  "The Growth Difficulties of Passive SaaS"

Idealistically, there are two types of SaaS products. **Active** and **Passive**. The key difference is that **Active** SaaS accomplishes it's primary function when you aren't using it. Essentially, *the magic happens in the background*. [Crazy Egg](http://crazyegg.com) is a great example - it collects cursor/eye tracking data automatically.

For the majority of 2013, I've been spending my time growing Passive SaaS products. It's very different. Especially compared to growing an Active product.

I'll admit, it took me awhile to realize the differences and new challenges with the change. Switching over was more difficult than expected because it wasn't a simple change in a product category. It was a dynamic change overall.

### The Difference in Pitch
When you step back and view the industry as a whole, the majority of **Active SaaS** products sell you *data*. Data that would be otherwise difficult to acquire. Crazy Egg, Mixpanel, Moz, KISSmetrics, etc..

These all help you gather data. Without their product, you are left guessing. Hosting solutions aside, it all revolves around data.

For **Passive Saas**, the same core functionality can be achieved by another manner. As an example, Evernote, [Stride](https://strideapp.com), and [Divshot](http://divshot.com); stripped down to their core features, Evernote is a journal, Stride is sales notebook, and Divshot is a html editor.

However, the products as a whole make up something different, something that saves you *time*; they help you streamline your workflow. You can achieve the same result without them, but chances are, you will be less organized and wasting time.

### Difficulties
The inherent difference when selling and marketing these two types of products comes down to how much time you have. It's the human factor.

With **Active** products, your success depends on how well you demonstrate the value of your product sometime after the initial signup. It doesn't matter if you are going for revenue or active users, you will have a longer time span to show your users value.

Compared to **Passive** products, the product increases value only when it is used. You will have to capture your users early on. If they don't get it within the first few days of using it, they are likely not going to continue, let alone pay.

Time is the main difference as humans have short attention spans. It comes down to the *time* x *value* density. While one product gathers value automatically with time. The other increases value only when it's used.

### Example
When working on [Divshot](http://divshot.com), I focused on pitching value early on. There are many different ways on how to demonstrate value quickly. Here are the results:

> This is the signup conversion rate. When continually tweaking how we demonstrated value up front, the conversion rate increases.

I'm still collecting information on *average time to paid conversion*, but I suspect that as more value is demonstrated up front, the average time will drop.

### Value Based Marketing
I've seen a lot of different ways to pitch an **Active** product. You push the product, straight and pure. Assuming you did your job in finding the correct audience, it will sell itself. This is the "*what*" pitch.

On the other hand, a **Passive** product requires a value driven approach. Pitching the product alone does not necessarily demonstrate immediate value towards the user. You must pitch use case, product value, and story. All in one. You pitch "*why*".

### Putting it all Together
Though there are similarities with both types of SaaS, the approach you take  comes down to the product itself. *It begins with the product*.
