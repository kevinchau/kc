title:  "A Love Hate Relationship With Seattle"
categories: blog
---

There's a lot going on with Seattle. It's why I want to leave and why I haven't left yet.

### Love: Nearby Nature

Admittedly you'd be hard pressed to find so much nature in another medium sized city. Winter sports are within an hour drive away, and so is the ocean. You can go kayaking with Orcas and sit down for a latte right after. Nature is in Seattle's DNA. You'll find the most epic REI store, and people take their Gore-Tex seriously. In a day, you can go surfing, rock climbing, skiing, or hiking, and still come home to sleep in your own bed.

### Hate: Transportation

Seattle drivers suck. They're super accident prone, they drive 55 in the passing lane, and extra passive aggressive. It's so bad in fact, that the local insurance company, Pemco, [has a running series of satirical commercials around it](http://www.werealotlikeyou.com).

Then there's the lame excuse for a public transportation system. It's where bendy buses crash into cars, cause traffic, and jacknife in the snow. Granted there's now a light rail system, and the streetcar is making a comeback. But it's still pretty darn inconvenient and is probably why no one takes it - it's still faster to drive or bike.

Don't even think about leaving your home when it snows. An inch will shut down the whole city.

### Love: The Abundance of Outstanding Food

There's a lot of **great** food here. Seattle is home to chefs like Tom Douglas, Lisa Nakamura, Ethan Stowell, Shiro Kashiba, and Rachel Yang. I consider outstanding food where a dish is good enough where I refuse to try it or a similar dish elsewhere, as it would be a waste of caloric intake.

Most recently, that spectrum of deliciousness has been rounded off by Texas BBQ over at [Jacks](http:/www.jacksbbq.com). Just add that to the plethora of seafood here. So whatever the food is, Vegan/Vegetarian, French, Italian, Seafood, or Mediterranean, you'll find it here, and it'll be damn good.

I can't say the same for coffee. The best coffee I've had still comes from San Francisco at [Philz](http://www.philzcoffee.com). People here have a surprisingly lack of standard for that.

### Hate: General Lack of Fashion Sense

They start you young here. Go to the University of Washington campus just a few minutes north of Downtown, and the typical uniform consists of a North Face jacket and sneakers. Take that same stroll through Amazon campus in South Lake Union, Microsoft campus in Redmond, and it's the exactly same. Basically, people in Seattle don't know how to dress, nor do they care.

### Love: Wow, Where Did All These Creatives Come From?

There's a TON of creative in Seattle. From photographers like [Chase Jarvis](http://chasejarvis.com) and [Alec Watson](http://www.alecwatson.com) calling Seattle home, to Macklemore, and design studios like Teague. Seattle is a nurturing place for creatives. They're just all hiding in coffee shops.

That said, it's very easy to make connections in the creative community here.

### Hate: Overall Lack of Hustle and Genuineness

It is very easy to become complacent here, you can be mediocre and still get by. Because of that, there's a general lack of hustle, and a lack of people who are on the hustle. Most of the time you think you've met a hustler, they're a fake one. I've met a lot of people here who are starting startups for the sake of starting startups. No one works on "ideas", they work on "startups". If that passion is genuine, it's misdirected. You see the same crowd at Startup Weekends and other hackathons.

Stay away from the fake crowd, otherwise you're just going to get sucked in.

For the people that are genuine and actually good people, a lot of them are not from Seattle or raised here. [They also frequently leave](http://www.geekwire.com/2014/freakn-genius-las-vegas/)

### Love: Progressives

There's a lot of progressives here. Seattle is progressive by nature, and it's amazing to see problems being solved. From political issues to world health issues. It begins here.

### Hate: People are Wishy Washy

People here suck at giving definitive answers. For some reason - Seattleites can't commit to anything. They can't give you a definite yes or no. Seattle sucks at making decisions.

### Bonus Like: It's Still Relatively Cheap

Without a state income tax, and with cost of living on the lower end of "tech cities". Everything in Seattle is still relatively affordable. There are some spots were rent is off the charts, but there are still reasonable areas within good distance from life.

Combine that with food that isn't insanely expensive ($20-30 per person for dinners and drinks on average).

It's pretty affordable here.

### Bonus Hate: The Influx of Mainland Chinese is Ruining Seattle

Go to the Eastside or University Village or the UW Campus, you'll see what I'm talking about.

[From reckless driving](http://www.thenewstribune.com/2014/02/19/3057207/green-river-student-arrested-after.html) to [driving up rents and snatching up property](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/business/in-suburban-seattle-new-nests-for-chinas-rich.html?_r=0). There's a potential future problem here that previously impacted Vancouver, BC, and it's now happening to Seattle.
